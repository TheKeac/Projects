Basic Calculator Project

Description: A simple calculator program written in Python, designed as a first project to explore core programming concepts. The calculator supports various mathematical operations and includes error handling for invalid input and edge cases.

Features: 
- Performs operations such as:
  - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division
  - Exponentiation, Modulus, Floor Division
  - Square Root and Percentage
- Handles invalid user input gracefully, prompting the user to re-enter data.
- Prevents division by zero and square root of negative numbers.
- Loops through operations until the user chooses to exit.
- Built-in delay to allow users to view results before returning to the menu.

How to Run:

1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/TheKeac/basic-calculator.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd basic-calculator
3. Run the program: python calculator.py

Planned Enhancements
Version 2 of this project will include:
- A graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter.
- Expanded mathematical functionalities, like trigonometric operations.
- Interactive error messages and visual improvements.

About Me:
This project was created as my first step into Python programming to practice basic logic, user interaction, and error handling. I hope to continue improving it as I learn more about programming and GUI development.
